This architecture represents a typical Azure-based modern data processing pipeline for e-commerce data. The raw data is ingested via Azure Data Factory and stored in Azure Data Lake. Using Databricks and Apache Spark, the data undergoes several transformations, following the Bronze-Silver-Gold medallion architecture in Delta Lake. Finally, the refined data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics for reporting, analysis, and decision-making. This setup is ideal for large-scale e-commerce datasets requiring real-time insights and business-level analytics.
